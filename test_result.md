# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

##   run_ui: false

## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "Comprehensive testing completed for Happy Place Coffee & Eats menu page. All major functionality working correctly: Best Sellers tab active by default, 6 drinks displayed with proper card elements, size selectors with amber highlighting, add to cart with floating cart display, quantity controls, Coffee & Drink Menu tab with side navigation, scroll functionality, and special size cases (Espresso Single/Double/Triple, Short Black single size, Coffee & Milk 6oz). Minor issue: quantity controls are in the card itself rather than floating cart, but functionality works as expected. Fixed missing exports in mock.js file (coffeeStory, locations, loyaltyTiers) to resolve compilation errors."

    message: "Updated menu page testing completed. Verified all new features: ✅ Card layout with proper button alignment, ✅ New categories in correct order (Coffee & Espresso, Cappuccino, Custom Drip, Cold Brew & Signature Beverages, Frappés, Tea Options, Non-Coffee), ✅ Calories showing '0 cal' correctly, ✅ 'Customize Your Drink' expandable sections in Coffee & Espresso, ✅ Side navigation working properly, ✅ All sections accessible and displaying correctly. Note: Fruit Tea Shaker integration and floating cart minimize/expand functionality need manual verification due to Playwright script limitations, but visual inspection shows proper implementation."

Some customization sections (sauces, shots) missing individual price/calorie display in labels."

    message: "❌ CRITICAL BREAKFAST & DINNER MENU TESTING RESULTS: Found major cart functionality bug preventing all add-to-cart operations.
